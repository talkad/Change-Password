This is a small tester program which validates that you got the correct output on the example files we gave.
The tester should be run as a final sanity check, once you finished your work and just want to check that you get what we expect.

In order to run the tester do the following:
0. Make sure you have no compilation issues with your code.
1. Copy all your code files (“*.java” files) and paste them in the self_testing folder.
2. Open a terminal (AKA CMD) and CD (=“change directory”) to the self_testing folder.
3. Run the following command: “java -jar DSchecker.jar”.


Please note the following:
1. This *only* tests the example files and doesn’t cover other scenarios we plan to test you on in the future. But still, if you want to pass the automatic tests in the future, it is strongly recommended that you pass this tester as well.
2. Obviously this tester is related to the automatic testing procedure and has nothing to do with the manual checking we also will perform.
